# Whoami_
My name is Muhammad Al-Habib Ouadhour <br>
I'm from Tunisia, I am 26 yo.

# What do I like_
I'm interested in every thing related to the computers and operating systems.<br>
You can call me the Jack of all trades, Master of none üòÑ
<br>
But this was before, when I started I'd like to know everything.<br>
I heard about Linux.<br>
I started with Ubuntu then Linux Mint, after I learned some basics In Linux and taking the Introduction to Linux by Linux Foundation.<br>
Every week I reformat and I try another distro, I don't even remember them all üòÅ.<br>
One day I installed Debian and I liked the Philosophy of it, the stability etc ...<br>
But after 2 months and it was a record for me ü§™. I've Installed ArchLinux ü§ù, and from that day until now I am using it as a main operating system.<br>
<br>
Also I remember that one day I started to become a designer, so I've learned about Photoshop, Then switching to Gimp and Inkscape because I am using Linux.<br>
Then I've changed my Mind And I want to become a hacker, So I learned about networking, reading books taking courses ...etc<br>
<br>
And I can't of course forget my journey with Python.<br>
I've tried everything with Python, GUI with `tk`, `GTK` and `Qt` Frameworks, I even tried `Kivy` to build a mobile app for `Android`.
<br>
But Now I wanna become a **Full-Stack Developer**.
And now you can consider me as a **MERN Stack Developer**
<br>
# What I am doing right now_
Currently I am taking the freeCodeCamp courses to become a **Full-Stack Developer**.<br>
Also after completing these courses, I am going to take the [Become a MERN Stack JavaScript Developer
](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-mern-stack-javascript-developer) in [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com).<br>
<br>
After these two big courses, I have to start doing some applications to make experiences.<br>
And I am open to any kind of job that requires a **Junior Full-Stack Developer**.<br>
